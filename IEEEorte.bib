@Article{ osi7,
	abstract = {Considering the urgency of the need for standards which would allow constitution of heterogeneous computer networks, ISO created a new subcommittee for "Open Systems Interconnection" (ISO/ TC97/SC 16) in 1977. The first priority of subcommittee 16 was to develop an architecture for open systems interconnection which could serve as a framework for the definition of standard protocols. As a result of 18 months of studies and discussions, SC16 adopted a layered architecture comprising seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application). In July 1979 the specifications of this architecture, established by SC16, were passed under the name of "OSI Reference Model" to Technical Committee 97 "Data Processing" along with recommendations to start officially, on this basis, a set of protocols standardization projects to cover the most urgent needs. These recommendations were adopted by T.C97 at the end of 1979 as the basis for t he following development of standards for Open Systems Interconnectlon within ISO. The OSI Reference Model was also recognized by CCITT Rapporteur's Group on "Layered Model for Public Data Network Services." This paper presents the model of architecture for Open Systems Interconnection developed by SC16. Some indications are also given on the initial set of protocols which will-likely be developed in this OSI Reference Model.},

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits

book with edition, author and editor
Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

use et al. for so many names. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to do this
if desired, or "R. M. A. Dawson and others" can be used instead.

IEEEtran.bst will not issue a warning if the publisher is missing for

U.S. patent
Use the type field to override the patent type. e.g.,
type = "Patent Application"
The address is that of the assignee. Note that IEEE does not
display the assignee, the address, and only displays one date.

information should be entered as other BibTeX styles may use it.
alternatively, nationality could be entered as "U.S."

French Patent request, the language field must be entered in lower case

the words "Patent Application", etc. are used instead.

	author = "S. Konyagin",
	howpublished = "private communication",

an internet request for comments (RFC) as a misc entry type
It would also be nice to add a URL to these types of things.
RFCs can also be handled as electronic references.

page 181, reference \#14.

@Misc{ IEEEexample:miscrfc,

a software package as a manual
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical
Systems", page 205, reference \#20.
Sometimes they put the version/release information in the title.

@Manual{ IEEEexample:softmanual,
	title = "SaberDesigner Reference Manual",
	organization = "Analogy, Inc.",
	address = "Beaverton, OR",
	year = "1998",
	note = "Release 4.3"
}

a software package as an electronic reference
From the February 2003 issue of  "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 46, reference \#24. If there is no author or organization, a sorting
key is required for sorting styles. It might be a good idea to include
month and year fields as well.

misc for a German regulation

Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference \#7.

@Article{ IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
	author = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
	title = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
	journal = "Blue Book",
	number = "4",
	year = "1999",
	url = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}

CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a book
However, it is not a good idea to have to use the author field for
an organization (done here because the book entry type requires an
author field).

@Book{ IEEEexample:bluebookbook,
	author = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
	title = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
	series = "Blue Book",
	number = "4",
	publisher = "{CCSDS}",
	address = "Newport Beach, {CA}",
	year = "1999",
	url = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}

CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a manual
This is a much better approach, but uses the howpublished field.

@Manual{ IEEEexample:bluebookmanual,
	title = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
	howpublished = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
	organization = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
	address = "Newport Beach, CA",
	year = "1999",
	url = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}

CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.

@standard{ IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
	title = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
	howpublished = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
	organization = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
	address = "Newport Beach, CA",
	type = "Recommendation for Space Data System Standard",
	number = "101.0-B-4",
	month = May,
	year = "1999",
	url = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}

An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse\_article\_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse\_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse\_forced\_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax\_names\_forced\_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames\_show\_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames\_show\_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax\_names\_forced\_etal

CTLuse\_alt\_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt\_stretch\_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash\_repeated\_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname\_format\_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname\_latex\_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname\_url\_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.

Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
